"""Describe an assistant in plain words (beta): an interview that fills in a draft.

The admin talks to a Databricks-hosted chat model (`PORTAL_BUILDER_MODEL`, e.g.
`databricks-claude-sonnet-5-5`). The model never builds anything itself. It asks a
few questions, looks things up with read-only tools, and keeps a **draft** that has
exactly the shape the three existing builders already take (Supervisor Agent,
Genie space, Knowledge Assistant). Approving the draft hands it to those builders,
so every rule they enforce (validation, all-or-nothing create, who may do what)
applies unchanged. Nothing here can widen access.

Why it stores nothing
---------------------
Serving endpoints are stateless: the model sees only what is sent in each request.
So the browser holds the conversation and the draft and sends both on every turn;
the server keeps no session. Tool calls (the lookups) happen inside one request and
are not carried to the next, which is why the draft itself, not the transcript, is
the memory. What the admin types is never logged or recorded (same rule as the
audit log); only the finished assistant is, by the existing create routes.

Identity: every model call and every lookup runs under the admin's own token, so
Databricks decides what they can see. The model's output is treated as untrusted:
`check` re-validates the draft with the builders' own `clean` functions and
`verify` confirms that everything it names exists, both on each proposal and again
when the admin approves (the draft round-trips through the browser).

Learnt live (2026-10-08, `databricks-claude-sonnet-5-5` on Azure): the endpoint
rejects `temperature`; a reply's `content` is a string, null, or a list of blocks
that can include `reasoning` blocks carrying a signature, and the assistant
message must be sent back **unchanged** when tool results are returned.

Files and credentials (2026-10-08): the admin can attach files in the
conversation (attachments.py: saved to a folder they chose, under their token)
and the model reads them with `read_file`, whose output is labelled as data. A
tool that needs a credential that does not exist yet is not a dead end: the
model calls `request_connection` (a name and plain words only) and the admin
enters the value in a separate form (connections.py). **No credential value is
ever sent to a model**: values never enter the conversation or the draft, and
anything key-like the admin types or a file contains is removed before a model
call (`attachments.redact`), with a notice on screen.

Unconfirmed: the judge model (`PORTAL_BUILDER_JUDGE_MODEL`) is whichever endpoint
the operator names; nothing here assumes it supports tool calling.
