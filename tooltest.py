"""Try a new tool on real input before it is trusted, and repair what breaks.

Why this exists: a tool the designer wrote passed every automatic check and then failed on the
first real file (an ad book with merged cells: `'MergedCell' object has no attribute
'column_letter'`). Static checks cannot know how a real spreadsheet is laid out, and the only
real exercise a tool got was the optional test stage, after the assistant was built. So now,
once a new tool is running and **before** the assistant is built around it, the tool is called
the way an assistant would call it, on the files that are really in its folders.

How, and why it is safe
-----------------------
* **Model-written code runs only in its own app.** The portal never executes it. It talks to the
  deployed tool over MCP (streamable HTTP) under the admin's own token; the app runs as its own
  service principal with only the folders it declared.
* **Only read-only abilities are run automatically.** A tool declares which abilities change
  something (`readOnlyHint` on the wire, `changes_data` in its card). Those are listed as not run:
  firing a "save" or "send" at a real folder to see what happens is not a test, it is an action.
* **Inputs are real.** The folders the tool declared are listed (as the admin) and the model
  writes calls from the tool's input schema and the file names it actually finds, plus one
  deliberately wrong call per ability where a clean refusal is expected, never a crash.
* **A bad test is not a bad tool.** The wire format tells them apart (seen live): a crash comes
  back `isError` with the exception text; a handled refusal is `ok: false`; a call whose
  arguments do not fit the schema is rejected before the tool runs ("validation error") and is
  reported as not checked.
* **Repairs are proposed, shown as a diff, approved, then deployed.** The code model is told what
  failed and returns a corrected version; it must pass the same static checks as the original;
  the admin approves its fingerprint; only then is it deployed (`forge.install_app`) and the
  tests are run again. Nothing a model wrote is deployed unseen, here or anywhere.

Unconfirmed: calling a tool's app with the signed-in user's token **inside a deployed portal** (the
Apps proxy accepted the local CLI token and the OAuth user token in local dev; whether the token
forwarded to a deployed portal carries the right scope is untested). When the tool cannot be
reached the check says so and the build can still go on.
