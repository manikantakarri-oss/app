"""MCP catalog: tools kept in a GitHub repo, deployed as Databricks Apps on demand.

The portal still stores nothing. The repo is the catalog (one folder per MCP, each
with an `mcp.yaml` card and an `app.yaml`); Databricks is the state. An MCP is
"deployed" when a Databricks App with its name exists, and the name is a rule, not
a record: `mcp-<folder>`, unless the card sets `app_name` for an app that already
exists under another name. Delete the portal and nothing is lost.

Why one tarball: `codeload.github.com` serves the whole repo in a single request
with no API rate limit (api.github.com allows 60 an hour per address, which a
shared Apps egress address could hit). The same download is the catalog and, on
deploy, the source, so what is listed is what gets deployed.

Choosing: a person ticks tools in the assistant wizard. On create or save, `plan`
attaches the ones already running and `deploy_and_attach` deploys the rest in the
background, adding each to the assistant when its app is up. Nothing is deployed
from the picker itself.

Folder access: a freshly installed app runs as its own new service principal, which
has no access to anyone's volumes. The card's `needs.volumes` (read / write) says
what the tool uses, and the assistant's Files step says which folders, so once the
app exists `grant_volumes` gives that principal just that access (READ_VOLUME on
the folders people upload to, READ_VOLUME + WRITE_VOLUME on the folder results go to
(a file write is refused without both), plus the
USE_CATALOG / USE_SCHEMA that reaching a volume takes). It runs as the admin, so
Databricks only allows what that admin could grant themselves; a refusal is logged
with the exact grant to make by hand.

Identity: same rule as the builder. The admin's token first; the app's service
identity only when Databricks says the token lacks the scope. If the app identity
creates the app, the admin who asked is made its manager.

Unconfirmed against a live workspace (built from memory of the Apps and Workspace
APIs, not run): that the admin's Apps token lacks a scope and so the app identity
does the work (no `apps` user scope is requested: its name is a guess and a bad
scope name breaks the whole scope update); `format: AUTO` importing plain
`.py`/binary files as workspace files; whether the new app's service principal can
read `/Workspace/Shared/agent-portal-mcps/<folder>` without a grant; and that a
Supervisor Agent may call the deployed app without a further grant. Any failure is
reported as Databricks said it. Do not call this verified.
