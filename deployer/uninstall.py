"""Take the portal out of a client's workspace, when the client is removed from
the deployer. Runs in the deploy job (action `uninstall`), as the client's own
service principal.

Removed: the portal app (its own service principal and everyone's access to it
go with it) and its release folders; and, only when asked, the portal's chat
history, activity and problem tables.

Kept, on purpose: the client's assistants, and the tools (MCP apps) the portal
installed, with their keys in the `agent-portal` secret scope and their code in
`/Workspace/Shared/agent-portal-mcps/`. Assistants call those tools, so removing
them would break assistants that keep working without the portal. The
installer's service principal is the client admin's to delete.

Each step is best effort and idempotent: something already gone is fine, a
refusal is reported, and a run can simply be repeated.
